Expected Timeline (Design Thinking Framework):

Phase 1 – Empathize & Define (August 19 – September 5)
Conduct comprehensive research on existing productivity applications, both local and global. Administer surveys and conduct short interviews with Egyptian students to pinpoint their specific pain points. Formulate clear problem statement(s) based on research findings.

Phase 2 – Ideate (September 6 – September 20)
Brainstorm a wide range of potential features and solutions. Prioritize features, distinguishing between must-have and nice-to-have functionalities. Develop initial sketches and low-fidelity wireframes.

Phase 3 – Prototype (September 21 – October 15)
Create mid to high-fidelity UI mockups using Figma. Design a localized user experience, incorporating Arabic text and local payment flows. Integrate accessibility-friendly design choices, such as high contrast, text size options, and simplified navigation. Conduct internal testing within the development team.

Phase 4 – Test & Iterate (October 16 – November 10)
Perform usability testing with a small, representative group of students. Collect feedback and iteratively refine user flows. Conduct specific accessibility testing, evaluating font readability, dark mode functionality, and screen reader compatibility. Prepare a polished final prototype.

Phase 5 – Finalize & Present (November 11 – November 15)
Develop a comprehensive final design deck and a clickable prototype. Document all research findings, user personas, accessibility considerations, and the complete design process. Prepare a compelling presentation or demonstration.

Accessibility Features

To ensure inclusivity, OnZone will integrate the following accessibility features, contingent on technical feasibility. High color contrast with an optional dark mode. Simple navigation flows designed to be ADHD-friendly. Compatibility with screen readers and voice commands. Optional focus sounds including Quran recitation, white noise, and soft background ambience.

Requirement Gathering

Functional Requirements (What should the app do?)
The Focus Zone is a customizable timer that blocks distractions and displays suggested tasks for the day. The To-Do List allows creating and managing tasks by priority, deadline, and category with quick search and the ability to link tasks to focus sessions. The Study Zone supports uploading and viewing PDFs, videos, and audio notes, provides distraction-free viewers, and allows note-taking, with a possible future AI quiz feature. The Progress Zone tracks focus time, streaks, XP, and achievements, provides analytics, and supports optional sharing of streaks. The Profile section lets the user set language, academic details, notification preferences, and accessibility preferences.

User Needs & Research Evidence (Why?)
The biggest pain for surveyed students was social media, notifications, and boredom constantly breaking concentration, reported by 100% of surveyed students. Students wanted a central, AI-supported to-do system, with 100% expressing the need. 83% asked for videos and resources inside the app to avoid distractions. 50% already use their phones for YouTube or PDF learning during study. Motivation through progress tracking, streaks, and genuine accomplishments was identified as key to consistent daily focus.

Key Non-Functional Requirements
Simplicity: Users can start a focus session or add a task in less than two steps. Accessibility: Adjustable text size, dark mode, and Arabic interface, with screen-reader support. Performance: App should launch fast in under two seconds, work offline, and run smoothly with many tasks. Privacy: No sensitive data in notifications and users control what information they share.

What’s Not Included due to constraints?
No YouTube API streaming; manual upload only. No complex AI or payment features at MVP stage. No group study or collaborative features for now.

Problem Statement

Egyptian university students struggle to study effectively due to social media, phone notifications, noisy homes, and a lack of integrated educational tools. Current productivity apps are inadequate, offering superficial distraction blocking or general task management, but fail to combine both with Arabic-first content and adaptable planning for student needs.

As a result, most students are aware of focus apps but do not adopt them. Learning sessions are fragmented by digital temptations and environmental disruptions. Students lack a centralized tool to organize tasks, access course material, track real academic progress, and stay motivated in daily Egyptian life.

OnZone is a mobile app for Egyptian students, offering distraction blocking, study management, learning content, and motivation in a culturally relevant and accessible interface to overcome educational barriers.

Project Objectives

Enable effective, distraction-free study by providing one-tap focus sessions with robust notification and app blocking and reducing social media and phone interruptions using adaptable blocking modes. Centralize task and workload management by combining daily and weekly to-do lists with study goals, prioritization, and scheduling in a student-first interface. Integrate educational content to allow students to upload and view PDFs, videos, and notes inside the app and prevent algorithm-driven distractions by keeping learning materials within a focused environment. Motivate through progress and achievement by tracking streaks, XP, and meaningful badges tied to genuine study milestones and offering analytics and personal study reports to reinforce habit formation and self-improvement. Serve all Egyptian students with accessibility and local relevance by supporting Arabic and English languages, adjustable text size, dark mode, and audio focus options that respect real student contexts: noisy homes, exam pressures, and religious routines. Collect feedback and iterate quickly by launching a validated MVP into pilot usage, prioritizing usability testing, and rapidly evolving according to student needs.

Overall Goal: OnZone aims to be the last app students open before every study session: a singular, reliable home for productive, motivated, and organized student achievement in Egypt.

User Stories & Use Cases

Scenario 1: Morning Rush Before College
Ahmed, a business student at Cairo University, wakes up late and has only forty minutes before class starts. He launches OnZone on his phone, taps into the Focus Zone, and starts a Pomodoro session. Notifications for TikTok and WhatsApp get blocked, letting him revise his accounting lecture notes. Goal: Rapid, distraction-free revision before a critical lecture. Pain point solved: No more doom-scrolling or chat interruptions in those hectic pre-class minutes.

Scenario 2: Exam Cram in a Noisy Flat
Fatma is preparing for her engineering midterms from her family apartment in Maadi. With the TV blaring and siblings fighting over the remote, she uses OnZone’s Study Zone to upload her professor’s PDF slides and play white noise. She sets her Today's Tasks and sees her progress streak tick up after each completed session, staying motivated despite the commotion. Goal: Maintain deep focus and structure while studying in a busy home. Pain point solved: No need to leave the app or get distracted by external chaos.

How These Use Cases Illustrate Value
Every scenario is rooted in Egyptian student realities: noisy homes, social media urges, spontaneous group work, religious customs, and tight schedules. App features directly solve the most relevant pain points: rapid distraction blocking, in-app study tools and content, progress streaks that keep motivation high, and flexible personalization such as audio and accessibility themes. The UX outcome is that real students adopt OnZone because every interaction fits their lifestyle, environment, and actual daily struggles instead of generic student life assumptions.
